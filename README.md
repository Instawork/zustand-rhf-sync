zustand-rhf-sync
---

Syncs zustand's store state with the form state in [react-hook-forms](react-hook-form.com). 

This allows form updates to immediately reflect in your store and allows the components that subscribe to your store to update based on form updates. 

## Install

```bash
npm install -save zustand-rhf-sync
```

Or with yarn 

```bash
yarn add zustand-rhf-sync
```
